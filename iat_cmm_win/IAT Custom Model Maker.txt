IAT Custom Model Maker allows everyone to create his own custom model easily.


# INSTRUCTIONS

Prepare a dataset folder.
The dataset folder should have a directory structure of this kind:

mushrooms_photos
|__ amanita_muscaria
    |______ im_a1.jpg
    |______ im_a2.jpg
    |______ ...
|__ champignons
    |______ im_c1.jpg
    |______ im_c2.jpg
    |______ ...
|__ boletus
    |______ im_b1.jpg
    |______ im_b2.jpg
    |______ ...
	
The subfolder names are also the labels used in metadata to identify the elements, so you should to use appropriate names, 
the name of various image files isn't important. The images format must be jpeg or png.
To have good results you need hundreds of images for each category. More appropriately varied data, allow better accuracy.
The images for each label should be well balanced. 
E.g., considering the above sample isn't good to have 200 champignons images and 1000 amanita muscaria images, 
otherwise the dataset will be biased towards the specific class.

When you have a proper dataset, launch the app using the link created by setup. Select the dataset and wait the creation of the model. 
This is a computationally heavy procedure and requires some time to be completed. 

The model file is named model.tflite, you can rename it using an indicative name (maintaining the extension) e.g. mushrooms.tflite
This file must be placed in "Image Analysis Toolset\TFModels" path. 
Done this, it's enough to configure in the settings menu the model name to use it for the custom detection features.



# SETTINGS:

Optionally you can try to tune the settings rather than using the default configuration.

This tool is a preliminary version and currently supports 2 different neural networks:
- Deep CNN ENL(used by default) is more efficient and scalable;
- Deep CNN MNV2 tends to generate smaller model files.

Epochs is a hyperparameter that defines the number of times that the learning algorithm will work through the training dataset.
The model accuracy is influenced by this parameter: 
- a too low number will cause underfitting; 
- a too high number will cause overfitting.
The optimal number depends on many factors, and should be determined with empirical tests.
Note that higher is the number, slower is the process. 

Test data split percentage, indicates the percentage of images in the dataset that will be used for the test set during train.
